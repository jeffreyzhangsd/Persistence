## :memo: App Ideas

:::info

1. KeepUp:
    - inspiration: BeReal
    - Like BeReal except instead of posting an image of what you're doing, you can just say anything or leave a message or you could take a photo/video for a group of friends instead (not just everyone you're friends with)
    - good way for groups to "keep up"
2. Persistence:
    - inspiration: I always forget to stretch or drink water during the day, 20/20/20 rule
    - Habit app where you set the notification setting to like a banner or something so whenever you open your phone/ check notifications you will see a reminder to stretch or walk or drink water
3. Memoire:
    - inspiration: google photos
    - trip memory app where you add friends to a group and take a bunch of photos, then there's a map where you can see the location of all the photos you took and like follow the path you traveled whenever you look back at it (ios usually saves location of your images)
4. Comms:
    - inspiration: BeReal
    - instead of photos, leave a voice memo of what's going on, or make weird noises, whatever sounds good
5. Dailies:
    - inspiration: when someone mentions that they have to do their dailies
    - tracker to help note down what daily thing someone may have to do, whether it be gaming related or just something you do on a day to day basis -> create a daily and then mark it done for the day, then it refreshes the next day

Persistence or KeepUp/Comms (kind of same idea)
- seem like something I could do in the time frame

## :pencil: App evaluation - [P]ersistence / [K]eepUp

:::success
Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
- What makes your app more than a glorified website?
    - P / K: ease of use, people usually carry phones around
- Try for 2 or more of these: maps, camera, location, audio, sensors, push, real-time, etc
    - P: real-time notifications / K: communication

Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
- How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
    - P: habit builders might find it useful
- How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?
    - K: friends would probably like to try it out at least, keep using it as long as it's casual and not a long process to try to keep up with others

Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
- What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
    - P: whoever likes habits (a lot of people)
    - K: friend groups around the world
- Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
    - P: good amount of value, might help in the long run for anything
    - K: maybe not as much value, i mean people can just text and leave voice memos in imessage
- Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
    - P: anyone willing to build a habit/in need of a reminder
    - K: friend groups (younger people might be more willing to use)

Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
- How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
    - P: possibly everyday
    - K: also everyday
- Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?
    - P: consume and create reminders around it
    - K: consume and create memories :sunglasses: 

Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
- How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?
    - P: just need to set up some kind of timer to keep running in the background kind of
    - K: might need some more work figuring out making groups and chatting and stuff
- Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
    - P: maybe yeah
    - K: maybe, if I only focus on like a message instead of all the other options
- How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
    - P: main idea is there
    - K: open to growing
:::

1. Persistence
    - Description: Notification app that will persistently notify user to stretch/drink water/walk around every 20 minutes or so
    - Category: Habit Building
    - Mobile: Portable, can be reminded anywhere
    - Story: I forget to stretch or fix my posture sometimes, so an app that does this may help, especially since I always have my phone near me
    - Market: Virtually everyone
    - Habit: Daily use to build a habit
    - Scope: Just make it for everyone to use, everyone can save their own schedule locally or something like that

2. KeepUp
    - Description: Simlar to BeReal, but not just photos and limited from public to just groups of friends
    - Category: Social Media/ Communication
    - Mobile: Ability to contribute from anywhere
    - Story: My friends and I don't always have something to say during every waking moment of the day, but if we were prompted to say something I feel like we could at least talk about something everyday which would be cool
    - Market: Groups of friends (maybe younger people)
    - Habit: Daily usage to keep up with others
    - Scope: 
        - First idea would just be to have a group, and a user would have to contribute to see other's messages or something like that
        - Then move to be able to add voice memos or images/videos
        - App would be open to growth for more ways to connect

## :triangular_flag_on_post: FINAL IDEA

:::success
PERSISTENCE
-
- Seems like something I can make
- Seems more useful to people in general
- Sounds fun, have a general starting idea
